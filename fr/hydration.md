In `entry-client.js`, we are simply mounting the app with this line:

``` js
// this assumes App.vue template root element has id="app"
app.$mount('#app')
```

Since the server has already rendered the markup, we obviously do not want to throw that away and re-create all the DOM elements. Instead, we want to "hydrate" the static markup and make it interactive.

If you inspect the server-rendered output, you will notice that the app's root element has a special attribute:

``` js
<div id="app" data-server-rendered="true">
```

The `data-server-rendered` special attribute lets the client-side Vue know that the markup is rendered by the server and it should mount in hydration mode.

In development mode, Vue will assert the client-side generated virtual DOM tree matches the DOM structure rendered from the server. If there is a mismatch, it will bail hydration, discard existing DOM and render from scratch. **In production mode, this assertion is disabled for maximum performance.**

### Hydration Caveats

One thing to be aware of when using SSR + client hydration is some special HTML structures that may be altered by the browser. For example, when you write this in a Vue template:

``` html
<table>
  <tr><td>hi</td></tr>
</table>
```

The browser will automatically inject `<tbody>` inside `<table>`, however, the virtual DOM generated by Vue does not contain `<tbody>`, so it will cause a mismatch. To ensure correct matching, make sure to write valid HTML in your templates.
